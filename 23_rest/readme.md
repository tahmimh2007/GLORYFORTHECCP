## DISCO
- `urllib.request.urlopen` to open URL
- `.read` returns the contents of the webpage that was opened
- `json.loads`: JSON object string -> Python dictionary
- `json.dumps`: Python dictionary -> JSON object string
## QCC
- How would the program work off of a fresh clone if the key_nasa.txt file is not tracked by git?
- Nothing appears in the console when the page is loaded; is that okay?

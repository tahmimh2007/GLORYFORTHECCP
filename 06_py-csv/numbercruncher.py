HOW THIS SCRIPT WORKS: We first read from the csv file, storing the information in a dictionary with the key as the percent incremented
over time and the value is the occupation. We assigned each occupation a range. We then generated a random number from 0 to 99.8 (total percent)
and returned the occupation that fell into the range of that occupation.

        dic = {}
        for row in content:
            percent += float(row[1])
            percent = round(percent, 1)
            dic[percent] = row[0]

        dic.popitem()
